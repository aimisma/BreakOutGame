This is  your classic BreakOut Game but with a framework to add as many levels as you want* and, as long as you follow the naming convention, no changes in the game mechanics are needed for them to be integrated.
It has a memory that stores the top 10 scores. Every new level your lives are restored back to three.

*Well, a small lie: It has a limit of 99 levels, so far it has three.
